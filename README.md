# plaisio
Plaisio is a 2D frame static analysis program made for my enjoyment/practice.

##Goals:

- Analyze frames using the force method
- Analyze frames using the movement method
- Make a nice, easy to use UI (which is really hard to find for this kind of software)
- Finite element method... Maybe?
- Perhaps even some dynamic analysis in the far future
